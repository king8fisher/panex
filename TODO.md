# TODO

## Tunnel Demo
Recursive panex tunnel - spawn nested panex instances to create a visual tunnel effect. Good dogfooding opportunity.

## End2End Testing
Golden file testing: render terminal buffer to string, compare against snapshots. Use `insta` crate for snapshot management. Test buffer/state layer; skip full visual TUI testing.

## Resource Prioritization
Distribute resources evenly across running processes.

## Mouse Selection
Support text selection with mouse in output panel.
